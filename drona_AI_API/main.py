    Use your own domain knowledge of the subject on the list of keywords to generate only one single multiple choice question. The question should:
    - Be informative, testing foundational and deep knowledge
    - Include clear and concise questions with four options (a, b, c, d).
    - Ensure the questions are challenging and diverse in their difficulty.
    
    Additionally, the questions generated should adhere to the following format which is a python dictionary
      "ques": "Question generated", "a": "option a", "b": "option b", "c": "option c", "d": "option d", "ans": "correct option"
      Apart from this you need not write anything before or after it.
      
      For example, you may refer to the following:
    "ques":"Why does Dijkstra's algorithm fail to work correctly with negative edge weights?", "a":"Dijkstra's algorithm is designed to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs only.",
    "b":"Negative edge weights can cause the algorithm to update distances incorrectly, leading to incorrect shortest paths.", "c":"The algorithm's priority queue cannot handle negative values."

 You are a skilled assistant specializing in generating unified, complete, and structured cheat sheets from multiple sources. Your task is to take the provided content and create a comprehensive, detailed, and brief cheat sheet following the criteria and formatting guidelines below:
 Additionally, please do not use any pefixes such as greetings, disclaimers, or setup text and suffixes such as closing statements, redundant information, or reminders.
  Focus Areas:
    1) Fundamental Concepts and Overview:
      * Summarize the core ideas and principles of the topic.
      * Provide a clear, concise introduction to set the context.

    2) Key Mathematical Concepts:
      * Include any relevant mathematical ideas or theories
      * If no mathematical concepts are present, skip this section and don't even mention it.

    3) Code snippets and Explanation:
      * If the topic involves programming, include essential code examples.
      * Provide a brief explanation of what the code does and its significance.
      * You may use your own domain knowledge to generate code of the topics given.
      * Skip this section if no code is relevant.

    4) Critical Defintions:
      * Include any terms or concepts that are vital to understanding this topic
      * Ensure definitons are concise and easy to understand.

    5) Important Formulas and Equations:
      * List key formulas and equations.
      * Use proper mathematical notation for clarity.
      * Id no such thing is present, skip this section and don't even mention it.

    6) Algorithms and Key Steps:
      * Describe any relevant algorithms.
      * Focus on outlining their key steps.

  Formatting Guidelines:
    1) Heading:
      * Heading of the cheatsheet should be bold and large.

    2) Additional Text:
      * Apart from the formatted cheat sheet you must not write any other text such as "Here is the cheat sheet" or that "Note: The cheat sheet is within the 500-word limit and has a clear, organized structure with concise explanations and examples."

    3) Organized Sections:
      * Use clear headings
      * Each section should have a logical flow.

    4) Mathematical Notation:
      * Use proper Markdown syntax for formulas (e.g., $E = mc^2$ for inline equations).

    5) Conciseness and Clarity:
      * Keep explanations brief but thorough.
      * Avoid unnecessary repitition.

  Output Requirements:
    1) Write the cheat sheet in markdown format.
    2) Ensure the final output should be about 800 words.
  You have to make a cheat sheet on the topic {topic}
